# Shapes

A simple, beginner-friendly ClojureScript library for drawing shapes
that targets the SVG standard as implemented in modern web browsers
(as of summer 2017).

This work was inspired by a long tradition of similar works, starting
with the system described in Peter Henderson's 1982
paper
[_Functional Geometry_](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/257577/1/funcgeo2.pdf),
and followed by a Scheme interpretation that was presented
in
[_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/2_002e2.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e4),
which led to the version used
for
[_Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures_](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/).
